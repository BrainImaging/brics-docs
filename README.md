# BrICS Documentation

This repository is for the documentation of the [BrICS](https://github.com/sgurbani/brics) project, designed to be run on [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org). It is a separate repository because the primary project repository is private and so cannot be run in Read the Docs.

The markup and pip configuration files are in the root folder of this repository, while all of the Markdown files are in the `docs/` folder.
