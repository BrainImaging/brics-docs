# BrICS User Guide

> Created by Saumya Gurbani

Welcome to the official user guide for BrICS - the Brain Imaging Collaboration Suite. This guide serves to provide documentation on how to use this application as a user or administrator. It does not cover developer documentation; that can be found on the project's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sgurbani/brics).
> Note: the BrICS project is currently stored in a private repository. Contact one of the members of the Shim Lab if you are interested in becoming a developer. A licensing agreement and inter-institutional research agreement may be necessary for researchers outside of Emory University.

## Building this Guide
This guide is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a software package that converts Markdown files into a static website. The Markdown and configuration files for this guide are hosted in a separate GitHub repository at https://github.com/sgurbani/bricsdocs.

Once this guide is generated using MkDocs, the static HTML files are uploaded to this website hosted by GitHub Pages.
