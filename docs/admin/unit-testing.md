# Unit Testing
The Unit Testing view enables quick testing of many of the components of BrICS. It is composed of [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) - individual scripts that assess whether a specific function of BrICS is working. These can be developed for things like connectivity checks, algorithms, and connections between modules.

This view allows you to quickly run either specific tests, a specific category of tests, or all tests.

## Running a Test
To run a single test, click the **Run** button next to a test. The server will kick off the test and update when the test completes or errors out.

To run all tests within a category, click the **Run All** button for that category.
