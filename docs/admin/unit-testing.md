# Unit Testing
The Unit Testing view enables quick testing of many of the components of BrICS. It is composed of [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) - individual scripts that assess whether a specific function of BrICS is working. These can be developed for things like connectivity checks, algorithms, and connections between modules.

This view allows you to quickly run either specific tests, a specific category of tests, or all tests.
