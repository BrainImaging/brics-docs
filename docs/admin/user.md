## Authentication
BrICS can currently use two types of authentication - Shibboleth or the Auth0 service. Shibboleth allows one to login via single-sign on (SSO) using their institutional (e.g. Emory NetID) credentials. [Auth0](https://auth0.com) is a third party service that also allows SSO using a variety of providers, such as Google, GitHub, Microsoft, etc. There is a slight difference in how users are setup from each, so we'll include info on both below.
Currently, the main BrICS installation at https://brics.me utilizes Auth0 with sign-in through Google; if a different provider is selected, the instructions below may need to be adjusted. Similarly, we'll provide instructions for when using Shibboleth through Emory NetID.
