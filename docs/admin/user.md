# User Management
The User tab allows the creation, editing, and management of Users.

## Authentication
BrICS can currently use two types of authentication - Shibboleth or the Auth0 service. Shibboleth allows one to login via single-sign on (SSO) using their institutional (e.g. Emory NetID) credentials. [There is a slight difference in how users are setup from each, so we'll include info on both below.
