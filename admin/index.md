# BrICS Admin

This portion of the guide will show you how to use the Admin module to set up projects, users, and manage other settings for BrICS.

## Accessing the Admin Module
In order to access the Admin Module, your account must be an administrator within BrICS. If you are not an administrator, you will need to ask one of the administrators to add you.
> **Note**: if you're running a local version of BrICS, e.g. within a Docker container, by default no authentication is setup, and you are automatically logged in as an administrator.

Once you've logged in to BrICS, open up the left side bar by clicking the menu icon on the top right of the screen. If you're logged in as an administrator, a button labeled **Admin** will be available.
